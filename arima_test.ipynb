    "\n",
    "Rolling Forecast ARIMA Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The ARIMA model can be used to forecast future time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the predict() function on the ARIMAResults object to make predictions. It accepts the index of the time steps to make predictions as arguments. These indexes are relative to the start of the training dataset used to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we used 100 observations in the training dataset to fit the model, then the index of the next time step for making a prediction would be specified to the prediction function as start=101, end=101. This would return an array with one element containing the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also would prefer the forecasted values to be in the original scale, in case we performed any differencing (d>0 when configuring the model). This can be specified by setting the typ argument to the value ‘levels’: typ=’levels’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternately, we can avoid all of these specifications by using the forecast() function, which performs a one-step forecast using the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split the training dataset into train and test sets, use the train set to fit the model, and generate a prediction for each element on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rolling forecast is required given the dependence on observations in prior time steps for differencing and the AR model. A crude way to perform this rolling forecast is to re-create the ARIMA model after each new observation is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "We manually keep track of all observations in a list called history that is seeded with the training data and to which new observations are appended each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this all together, below is an example of a rolling forecast with the ARIMA model in Python.\n",

    "Configuring an ARIMA Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical approach for fitting an ARIMA model is to follow the Box-Jenkins Methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a process that uses time series analysis and diagnostics to discover good parameters for the ARIMA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the steps of this process are as follows:\n",
    "1.Model Identification. Use plots and summary statistics to identify trends, seasonality, and autoregression elements to get an idea of the amount of differencing and the size of the lag that will be required.\n",
    "2.Parameter Estimation. Use a fitting procedure to find the coefficients of the regression model.\n",
    "3.Model Checking. Use plots and statistical tests of the residual errors to determine the amount and type of temporal structure not captured by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is repeated until either a desirable level of fit is achieved on the in-sample or out-of-sample observations (e.g. training or test datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process was described in the classic 1970 textbook on the topic titled Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control by George Box and Gwilym Jenkins. An updated 5th edition is now available if you are interested in going deeper into this type of model and methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the model can be fit efficiently on modest-sized time series datasets, grid searching parameters of the model can be a valuable approach.\n",

    "– Just to be sure. model_fit.forecast() is single step ahead forecasts and model_fit.predict() is for multiple step ahead forecasts? \n",
    "\n",
    "– I am working with a series that seems at least quite similar to the shampoo series (by inspection). When I use predict on the training data, I get this zig-zag pattern in the prediction as well. But for the test data, the prediction is much smoother and seems to saturate at some level. Would you expect this? If not, what could be wrong?\n",

    "Concerning the second question. Yes, you are right the prediction is not very accurate. But moreover, the predicted time series has a totally different frequency content. As I said, it is smooth and not zig-zaggy as the original data. Is this normal or am I doing something wrong. I also tried the multiple step prediction (model_fit.predict()) on the training data and then the forecast seem to have more or less the same frequency content (more zig-zaggy) as the data I am trying to predict.\n",

    "Thanks for the great post! It was very helpful. I’m currently trying to forecast with the ARIMA model using order (4, 1, 5) and I’m getting an error message “The computed initial MA coefficients are not invertible. You should induce invertibility, choose a different model order, or you can pass your own start_params.” The model works when fitting, but seems to error out when I move to model_fit = model.fit(disp=0). The forecast works well when using your parameters of (0, 1, 5) and I used ACF and PACF plots to find my initial p and q parameters. Any ideas on the cause/fix for the error? Any tips would be much appreciated.\n",

    " 1. Let’s say I want to estimate an AR model like this: x(t)=a*x(t-2) + e. If I use ARIMA(2,0,0), it will add the term x(t-1) as well, which I don’t want. In SAS I would use p=(2) on the estimate statement of proc arima rather than p=2.\n",
    " 2. How do I incorporate covariates? For example, a simple model like this: x(t)=a*x(t-2) + b*f(t) + e, where f(t) e.g. is 1 if it’s the month of January and 0 otherwise.\n",

    "Thank you for the tutorial. It’s a good start to implementing an ARIMA model in Python. I have a question: You have used the actual data samples to update your training dataset after each prediction as given in “history.append(obs)”. Now let’s take a real life example when you don’t have any further actual data and you use your predictions only to update your training dataset which looks like “history.append(yhat)”. What will happen in this case? I am working on air quality prediction and in my case, the former scenario keeps the seasonal pattern in the test set but the latter does not show any seasonal pattern at all. Please let me know what’s your take on this.\n",

    "Hi Jason Brownlee!\n",
    " I have been following your blog since some time and the concepts and code snippets here often come handy.\n",
    " I’m totally new to time series analysis and have read some posts (mostly yours), a few lectures and of course questions from stackoverflow.\n",
    " What confuses me is, to make a series stationary we difference it, double differencing in case seasonality and trend both are present in the series. Now while performing ARIMA, the parameter ‘I’ depicts what? Number of times we have performed differencing or lag value we chose for differencing (for the removal of seasonality).\n",
    " For example, let say there is a dataset of monthly average temperatures of a place (possibly affected by global warming). Now there is seasonality (lag value of 12) and a global upward trend too.\n",
    " before performing ARIMA I need to make the series stationary, right?\n",
    " To do that I Difference twice like this:\n",
    " differenced = series – series.shift(1) # to remove trend\n",
    " double_differenced = differenced – differenced.shift(12) # to remove seasonality.\n",
    " Now what should be passed as ‘I’ to ARIMA?\n",
    " 2? As we did double(2) differencing\n",
    " or\n",
    " 1 or 12 as that’s the value we used for shifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also if you’re kind enough, can you elaborate more how *exactly* did you decide the value of ‘p’ and ‘q’ from acf and pacf plots.\n",

    "Hi Jason, I recently came accross your blog and really like the things I have learned in a short period of time. Machine learning and AI are still relatively new to me, but I try to catch up with your information. As the ARIMA Model comes from the statistics field and predicts from past data, could it be used as the basis of a machine learning algorithm? For example: if you would create a system that would update the predictions as soon as the data of a new month arrives, can it be called a machine learning algorithm? Or are there better standarized machine learning solutions to make sales predictions?\n",

Now I need to feed my data into a SARIMA Model for each month of the year so that I can use it to generate a fictive month of solar radiation.

I just want to run inference with an ARIMA the same way I would with e.g. RNN–train it up, then feed it arbitrary subsequences from a test dataset and generate the predicted next item in each case. As obvious as a use case as this is, I haven’t been able to see how to effectively do this. The predict method, for example, doesn’t seem to take in the current subsequence, which seems bizarre.

    "Thanks for the link to your other tutorial, that also was very helpful. But it seems to confirm that Python’s ARIMA can only predict just the few samples after the data set! Using that example, let’s suppose I want to predict days 8-14 past the end of the training set–at this point I’d want to take the real data from days 1-7 into account. But apparently I’d have to retrain the model, with the training data now extended to include these days 1-7. This makes no sense to me, I would have thought that an ARIMA model, once all its coefficients are determined, could be applied to any arbritrary sequence. A (7,0,1) model should need just the prior seven days to make a prediction right? *Any* prior 7 days. Help.\n",

    " Enjoyed this post, as usual. I believe, AIC and BIC are also good indicators of the ARIMA model fit. (lower the valuve, the better it is). Are there any direct indicators of Box-Jenkins method, built-in into the statsmodels or any other library?\n",

    "\n",
    "Rolling Forecast ARIMA Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The ARIMA model can be used to forecast future time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the predict() function on the ARIMAResults object to make predictions. It accepts the index of the time steps to make predictions as arguments. These indexes are relative to the start of the training dataset used to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we used 100 observations in the training dataset to fit the model, then the index of the next time step for making a prediction would be specified to the prediction function as start=101, end=101. This would return an array with one element containing the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also would prefer the forecasted values to be in the original scale, in case we performed any differencing (d>0 when configuring the model). This can be specified by setting the typ argument to the value ‘levels’: typ=’levels’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternately, we can avoid all of these specifications by using the forecast() function, which performs a one-step forecast using the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split the training dataset into train and test sets, use the train set to fit the model, and generate a prediction for each element on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rolling forecast is required given the dependence on observations in prior time steps for differencing and the AR model. A crude way to perform this rolling forecast is to re-create the ARIMA model after each new observation is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "We manually keep track of all observations in a list called history that is seeded with the training data and to which new observations are appended each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this all together, below is an example of a rolling forecast with the ARIMA model in Python.\n",

    "Configuring an ARIMA Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical approach for fitting an ARIMA model is to follow the Box-Jenkins Methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a process that uses time series analysis and diagnostics to discover good parameters for the ARIMA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the steps of this process are as follows:\n",
    "1.Model Identification. Use plots and summary statistics to identify trends, seasonality, and autoregression elements to get an idea of the amount of differencing and the size of the lag that will be required.\n",
    "2.Parameter Estimation. Use a fitting procedure to find the coefficients of the regression model.\n",
    "3.Model Checking. Use plots and statistical tests of the residual errors to determine the amount and type of temporal structure not captured by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is repeated until either a desirable level of fit is achieved on the in-sample or out-of-sample observations (e.g. training or test datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process was described in the classic 1970 textbook on the topic titled Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control by George Box and Gwilym Jenkins. An updated 5th edition is now available if you are interested in going deeper into this type of model and methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the model can be fit efficiently on modest-sized time series datasets, grid searching parameters of the model can be a valuable approach.\n",

When I use predict on the training data, I get this zig-zag pattern in the prediction as well. But for the test data, the prediction is much smoother and seems to saturate at some level.

    "Concerning the second question. Yes, you are right the prediction is not very accurate. But moreover, the predicted time series has a totally different frequency content. As I said, it is smooth and not zig-zaggy as the original data. Is this normal or am I doing something wrong. I also tried the multiple step prediction (model_fit.predict()) on the training data and then the forecast seem to have more or less the same frequency content (more zig-zaggy) as the data I am trying to predict.\n",

I’m currently trying to forecast with the ARIMA model using order (4, 1, 5) and I’m getting an error message “The computed initial MA coefficients are not invertible. You should induce invertibility, choose a different model order, or you can pass your own start_params.” The model works when fitting, but seems to error out when I move to model_fit = model.fit(disp=0). The forecast works well when using your parameters of (0, 1, 5) and I used ACF and PACF plots to find my initial p and q parameters. Any ideas on the cause/fix for the error? Any tips would be much appreciated.\n",

    " I have a general question about ARIMA model in the case of multiple Time Series:\n",
    " suppose you have not only one time series but many (i.e. the power generated per hour at 1000 different wind farms). So you have a dataset of 1000 time series of N points each and you want to predict the next N+M points for each of the time series.\n",

    "If one has a time series where the time steps are not uniform, what should be done while fitting a model such as ARIMA? I have price data for a commodity for about 4 years. The prices are available only for days that a purchase was made. This is often, but not always, every day. So sometimes purchases are made after 2, 3 or even more days and the prices are therefore available only for those days I need to forecast the price for the next week.\n",

I have a question: You have used the actual data samples to update your training dataset after each prediction as given in “history.append(obs)”. Now let’s take a real life example when you don’t have any further actual data and you use your predictions only to update your training dataset which looks like “history.append(yhat)”. What will happen in this case? I am working on air quality prediction and in my case, the former scenario keeps the seasonal pattern in the test set but the latter does not show any seasonal pattern at all.

Now while performing ARIMA, the parameter ‘I’ depicts what? Number of times we have performed differencing or lag value we chose for differencing (for the removal of seasonality).\n",
    " For example, let say there is a dataset of monthly average temperatures of a place (possibly affected by global warming). Now there is seasonality (lag value of 12) and a global upward trend too.\n",
    " before performing ARIMA I need to make the series stationary, right?\n",
    " To do that I Difference twice like this:\n",
    " differenced = series – series.shift(1) # to remove trend\n",
    " double_differenced = differenced – differenced.shift(12) # to remove seasonality.\n",
    " Now what should be passed as ‘I’ to ARIMA?\n",
    " 2? As we did double(2) differencing\n",
    " or\n",
    " 1 or 12 as that’s the value we used for shifting.\n",

    "Hi Jason, I recently came accross your blog and really like the things I have learned in a short period of time. Machine learning and AI are still relatively new to me, but I try to catch up with your information. As the ARIMA Model comes from the statistics field and predicts from past data, could it be used as the basis of a machine learning algorithm? For example: if you would create a system that would update the predictions as soon as the data of a new month arrives, can it be called a machine learning algorithm? Or are there better standarized machine learning solutions to make sales predictions?\n",

But apparently I’d have to retrain the model, with the training data now extended to include these days 1-7. This makes no sense to me, I would have thought that an ARIMA model, once all its coefficients are determined, could be applied to any arbritrary sequence.
